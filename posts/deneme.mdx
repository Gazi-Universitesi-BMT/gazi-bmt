## Introduction

Comparing to others, Grid is the newest and coolest way to build user interfaces. Grid allows you to build layouts in different ways. The most popular way is using grid-column and grid-row properties. But today, I am going to show you grid area and you will never use others anymore.

The reason I find this approach better is, It is more declarative, readable and easier to change. Also this approach reduces the line of code.

## Getting Started

First, we prepare our grid with grid-template properties.

```css
.container {
  height: 100vh;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 10vh 1fr 4fr 2fr 10vh;
  grid-template-rows: 10vh 2fr 1fr 3fr 10vh;
}
```

Notice that I use 10vh spacing in every side. You can configure your layout as you wish and I highly encourage you to.

Now I can create my sections at HTML and spread it over the grid.
